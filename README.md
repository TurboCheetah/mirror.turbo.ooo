A linux mirror in the Singapore region.

Inspired by my friends [Andrew](https://mirror.0x.sg), [Kenny](http://mirror.aktkn.sg) and [Likang](https://mirror.kst.asia/)

This mirror is ran on a [ViewQwest](https://viewqwest.com) 1gbps line, and offers the following packages:

Nginx is ran as a webserver, with traefik sitting in front as a reverse proxy (for my other services).
